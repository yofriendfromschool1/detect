If you are a personal user, educational user or no profit organisation you can use
protection id for free. 

If you are a corporate or a company (with 20 or more people), then you are expected to 
contact us for licensing terms and are not permitted to use protection id until we come 
to some agreement. (VirusTotal, Antivirus companies and Microsoft are obviously exempt from this).

The software is supplied AS IS, with no warranty (implied or otherwise).. 
while we strive to make it bug free, you run it entirely at your own
risk, we are not liable for any damages arising from its use.

Support and updates are entirely on an on demand basis, while we try and ensure that we are 
up to date, and offer support to those who email us, we do not guarantee a reply.

If you intend to package ProtectionID in some release, like a dvd of 'cracker tools', 
or similar, you must 

(1) NOT alter the zip file in any way, shape or form,
(2) NOT charge for it, 
(3) NOT alter any of the binaries (if you are including it unzipped).
